"""DISEASE SEARCH ENGINE"""

"""PROJECT DESCRIPTION"""
This project is developed to get disease information from a website. The user inputs a disease query, the program crawls and mines information from the internet. Finally, the retrieved data is processed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. 

The packages used for this project include Selenium and Sklearn. Selenium provides an automated interface to mine information. The package has handy information, therby easy to use and follow. Most of the work in this project included the construction of logic that retrieves information from a website. The website chosen to get information is Mayo Clinic. Their website provides information pertaining to a user's query and is also friendly to crawling activities. Data is extracted from the html elements of the Mayo Clinic's website.

The location of html elements have to be as denoted in the code for the correct extraction of data. This is a major challenge, as some diseases that do not follow the set criteria might not be retrieved.
